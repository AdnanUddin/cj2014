Questions:
	Are all pictures headshots facing forward?
	Is there only going to be one face per image?
	Are all pictures going to have the same background?
	Is the picture size the same for all pictures?

	Can we use libraries without specific facial recoginition features of said library?
	Can we use other AI libraries  (e.g. neural networks library)?
